Place the below files in the same root folder which also contains the "test and train" folders which contain the ham and spam folders respectively. 
1. sxr190067_NaiveBayes.py
2. sxr190067_Logistic_Regression.py


Run the Naive Bayes python file without any extra parameters.

The Logistic Regression file is hardcoded with below values -
Learning rate=0.001
Lambda=0.01
Iteration Count=100
remove_StopWords() is commented by default. Need to uncomment this line of code to check results for testing data without stop words.

These can be changed as required and the Logistic Regression file can be run without any extra parameters.
